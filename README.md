📗Tried "Optimal paths taken to avoid an already affected area by a contagious disease" in Mathematica using random-interpolated functions and the gradient of that function. This is an update of my previous project:

📌 This also takes on the idea of "Gradient of a scalar function" .In short a Gradient of a function depicts the idea that a function increases or decreases most rapidly in a certain direction(ie a vector)and that direction is represented by the Gradient of that function.
📌  The color arrangements were VIBGYORW  in this contour ,where the White (⚪️) region/s represents the most contagious or most affected area in the whole grid whereas the violet(🟣) region/s has the least effect until now . Our goal is to select the path which decreases the severity of the contagious disease the fastest.
📌 The following project also describes how to generate a random surface with the center having the most severity.
📌  The arrows(stream lines) marked in red(🟥)describes the path that should be taken to ensure a low possibility of the disease being contaminated(given that a person is at the tail of the arrows).
🖇N.B: The path is a close approximation of the original path .
